# Emailspam_Detection_Using_Ensemble_Technique
Email Spam Detection
SCOPE:
The project scope of email spam detection typically involves designing and implementing a system or different algorithms to identify and classify emails as either spam or legitimate (non-spam).

ABSTRACT:
The goal of this project is to develop a robust spam email detection system using ensemble learning techniques. The project utilizes four ensemble algorithms, namely Random Forest (Bagging), AdaBoost (Boosting), Stacking, and Majority Voting Classifier (Majority Voting).
Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple base classifiers to improve the overall performance and generalization of the spam detection system.
